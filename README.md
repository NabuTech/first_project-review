# First Project Review

## Description:

The purpose of this project is to showcase my journey in Software Development. Eye Candy Cinema
was my very first project an assignment for Web Concepts. My goal is to look back over my projects
analyse what I did and show how I have developed my skills. My 80s Movie Website is a quick do-over
of the fundamentals of Eye Candy Cinema. It will also form the backbone of a future project I wish
to engage adding API integration and back-end functionality. 

## Project Structure:
